## Design Steps

As a team we had big plans for what we wanted to include in our app. Using Excalidraw and Trello, we were able to prioritise and agree on the core functionality of our app and what this would look like.

Below are screenshots of our Excalidraw planning. Having this visual plan provided a reference point that we were able to revisit throughout the final project weeks. It also helped us to plan what information we would been needing from external APIs and how we would use it.
